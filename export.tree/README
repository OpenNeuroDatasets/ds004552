Project Title: Network-specific metabolic and hemodynamic effects elicited by non-invasive brain stimulation

This data depository contains DERIVATIVE at the group-level (n=16) files ONLY, and does not include individual subject-level data for subject confidentiality reasons. 

Specifically included are:
1. Spreadsheets relevant to TMS administration:
(a) Elapsed times between TMS and onset of image acquisitions.
(b) Motor thresholds by subject.
(c) Target coordinates for SAL-TMS and DN-TMS by subject.

2. NIFTI FDG-PET files in MNI152 common space (Post-TMS > baseline).

3. NIFTI MRI files in MNI152 common space:
(a) ROIs used in the main analysis (many derived by Yeo et al. J. of Neurophysiology 2011.
(b) Group-level functional connectivity changes (Post-TMS > Pre-TMS)
(c) Group-level functional connectivity changes (Post-TMS > baseline)

4. Spreadsheets related to quantitative changes resulting from TMS in:
(a) Whole-brain normalized standardized uptake 
(b) Functional connectivity 

5. Spreadsheet describing MRI quality control metrics.
